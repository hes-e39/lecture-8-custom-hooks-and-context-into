[Lecture Notes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-wFM1e9BXv1YQ8Dk3GxGgSoJJQZ5YAD8EDFJNiELSEE/edit?usp=sharing)

**Prerequisite: you have `node` installed on the command line and can run `node --version`**

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of this repository
2. Run: `npm install`
3. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/?wt.mc_id=vscom_downloads)
4. Open VSCode. Install the recommended extensions that pop up in the bottom right. If you don't see this, then you can manually install the following two extensions: [BiomeJS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome) and [TailwindCSS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss).
5. You might need to restart VSCode in order for extensions to take in effect. Restart by running `CMD+Shift+P` and search for "Reload Window", hit `Enter`.
6. Verify that BiomeJS is working by adding some extra indents/spaces in `src/main.tsx`. It should format the file on save.
7. Start the dev server with `npm run dev` and navigate to http://localhost:5173/
